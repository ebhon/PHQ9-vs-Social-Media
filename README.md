# Social Media Usage and Depression Level Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between social media usage and depression levels using publicly available datasets. The objective of this analysis is to explore how different types of social media usage are associated with depression levels in various age groups, genders, and other demographic factors.

### **Project Overview**
In this analysis, we explore the impact of social media on mental health, focusing specifically on depression levels. The goal is to understand how excessive social media usage could correlate with various mental health issues, particularly depression. The study includes various demographic factors, social media usage patterns, and depression levels, offering insights that may guide policymakers, mental health professionals, and the general public.
